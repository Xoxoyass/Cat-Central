# Tabby
A tabby cat is any domestic cat that has an M pattern on its forehead, stripes by its eyes, across its cheeks, along its back, around its legs and tail, and other dotted, lined, flecked, banded or swirled pattern on any part of its body. The "tabby" isnt a breed, but instead the pattern that is found in many cats.
