Everything there is to know about cats!

# Tabby
A tabby cat is any domestic cat that has an M pattern on its forehead, stripes by its eyes, across its cheeks, along its back, around its legs and tail, and other dotted, lined, flecked, banded or swirled pattern on any part of its body. The "tabby" isnt a breed, but instead the pattern that is found in many cats.

# Ginger
The ginger has its tiger like appearance with shades of orange red and gold plus their friendly (and crazy) personalities making it one of the most poplular breed. The ginger breed still has a hint of tabby in them with the stripe and dotted pattern that may appear on some of them.
